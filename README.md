## About me ü¶ä
Hey, my name is Kris, a transgender Content Creator living in Mexico City!

I do a lot of stuff on my free time but this is kind of a summary of what I do (both as a hobby and as a job):

+ Video Editing
+ Making Music
+ Coding/Developing
+ Hunting for Lost Media
+ Designing UI/UX concepts for apps that I use
+ ~~Being a useless member of society~~

I'm currently working for the Kritterhouse maintaining and developing their in-house (haha get it) projects like USBWorld and TKA. (I'm also the CEO/Founder of it lol)
